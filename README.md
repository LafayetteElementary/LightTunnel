# Trinket
This code attempts to have 3 output pins that are scheduled with a rainbow motion, each output being slightly lagged with the previous to simulate the effect of a wave as a user walks through the tunnel. The code has minimal compute and memory requirements, so even though tested on a Trinket Pro, this should work on a standard Trinket.

## Requirements
1. Using Arduino IDE 
1. Install the FastLED library: https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED
1. Adafruit Trinket Pro 16MHz
